00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm Adrian Higgins I'm a garden

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the garden columnist at The Washington Post.
[ Bling sound ]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Today we're going to show viewers

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
how to simply repot a houseplant.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000 
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You need to repot a house plant
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because in nature, they grow on the jungle floor.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But when you grow anything in a pot, in a container,
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
it's in an artificially constrained environment.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And those roots eventually are going to get strangled
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
upon themselves and spring is the time to do this.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Pot up maybe one inch or two inches.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This is a 6-inch pot and today

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm going to put it into an 8-inch pot.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Key thing is it does have to drain.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What I'm going to do now is just start at the bottom
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and start teasing the roots away from this form
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that they have created within the pot.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And I'm just being pretty gentle, but firm enough.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I want to stop it growing like a pot.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I want them to think they're back in the jungle.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This is pretty much done now.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You can remove up to a quarter of the roots.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And it will stress it, yes, but it's not at the moment in spring
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
where it's ready to grow and it will bounce back.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The first thing I want to do is put fresh potting mix
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in the bottom, for the roots to grow down into.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
How much you put in is a direct result
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
of actually the finished height of the plant,
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which is very important.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Ideally, you want it pretty much at the level
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
it was at the old pot,
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
but you want the crown to be maybe at the lip
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
or just below the lip level of the new pot.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And then with my other hand,
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm just throwing in the fresh soil,
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
which will anchor the plant at the height I want it.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You do need to sort of pack it down,
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
because you don't want air pockets
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
in the root system, that's bad for it.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Okay, that's pretty much where I need it to be.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
What you should do now is sort of tap
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the pot a couple of times.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And that helps to set the soil.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I like to groom the leaves, the top growth.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
SO that it looks as good as it feels.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
[chuckles] So I'll take off any brown or yellowing leaves.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And to sort of tell the world that I'm back from the groomer's
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and I'm like a poodle, all fluffy and happy
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and ready to go.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And a well-drained pot means that you can't overwater it.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The very worst thing you can do is kill it.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And I know that sounds glib.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Get your hands mucky, go in and do it.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
In time your trepidation will evaporate
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and your confidence will grow.
[ ♬ Happy and calm music in the background ♬ ]
